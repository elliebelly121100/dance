Tap is a style of dance that is all about rhythm! Tap is generally classified into two or three categories, rhythm tap, which is the main kind, broadway tap, which involves more hand movements than rhythm tap, and sometimes hoofing, which is a variation of all the kinds of tap. When you tap dance in a group, it's harder than dancing alone, because when just one person is off, everyone can hear it. Tap dance is great for anyone, but I would reccommend sticking with it for longer than you'd like. At the beginning, the class may appear boring, you begin with just toe and heel taps, but it gets really compicated and way more fun, with heel clicks and time steps and so much more. When you stick with it for a long time, your dances get faster, better, and more complicated!If you stick with tap, your sense of rhythm gets really good, which can help with musical timing on instruments and other dances. If you already have a good sense of rhythm, you'd be great at tap. And although some say tap is babyish, it really isn't. It can get really complicated, and seeing any famous tap dancer will show you how not-babyish it is. It's actually really complicated and fast, but more fun than the more mature styles like ballet.
